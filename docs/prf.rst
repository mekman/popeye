What is a PRF?
================

PRF stands for 'population receptive field'. In the most general sense, this is
a quantitative model of the responses of the population of cells contained
within an fMRI voxel (or other measurement of population activity, such as EEG,
EcOG, etc.)  that can interpret and predict the responses of this population to
different stimuli.

The use of PRF models was first pioneered by Dumoulin and Wandell [1]_ in analysis
of visual responses of fMRI voxels in the early visual cortex.
